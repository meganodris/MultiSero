Code for joint inference of infection prevalence and between-pathogen antibody cross-reactivity using cross-sectional, multi-pathogen serological data. 
The methods and applications of this analytical framework are presented in "Epidemiological inferences from serological responses to cross-reacting pathogens" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.12.24311852).
